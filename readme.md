## 📖 Project Overview

This study investigates how atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) influences soil nitrogen fixation processes and, in turn, affects major grain crop yields (maize and wheat) across China.

By integrating **remote sensing datasets**, **IPCC climate scenarios**, and **machine learning models**, the project:

- Quantifies **spatial transboundary pollution impacts**
- Identifies **critical NO₂ exposure thresholds**
- Reveals **high-risk agricultural regions**
- Proposes **targeted mitigation strategies**
